Introduction

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and early detection can play a vital role in saving lives. This project was built with the idea of using Artificial Intelligence to support healthcare professionals in predicting the risk of heart disease with greater accuracy.

Instead of relying on just one machine learning model, we combined the power of six different algorithms into a single ensemble system. By doing this, we were able to reduce errors, improve consistency, and create a more trustworthy prediction tool.

🔍 What the Project Does

Analyzes important health parameters like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and ECG readings.

Uses multiple machine learning algorithms together to produce more accurate results.

Provides clear insights into which factors contribute the most to risk.

Handles sensitive medical data securely, keeping privacy and security in mind.

🛠️ How We Built It

Languages & Libraries: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and Naïve Bayes

Approach: Ensemble learning — integrating results from all models to get the most stable and reliable output.

📈 Results

Our ensemble approach showed higher accuracy and stability compared to single algorithm models. It highlights how combining different strengths in machine learning can make AI solutions more dependable in real-world applications like healthcare.

👥 Team & Contributions
